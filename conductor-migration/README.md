# Netflix Conductor to Temporal Python Migration Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for migrating Netflix Conductor JSON workflow definitions to production-ready Temporal Python projects.

**Use this guide when:**
- You have a Conductor JSON workflow definition file
- You want to migrate from Conductor's declarative JSON DSL to Temporal's code-first Python approach
- You need a complete, tested, and documented Temporal project as output

**What this migration produces:**
- Complete Python project with workflows, activities, and worker
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Type-safe code with mypy strict validation
- Full documentation and setup instructions
- End-to-end validated working implementation

---

## Quick Start (TL;DR)

For experienced users who understand both Conductor and Temporal:

1. **Ensure prerequisites**: Python 3.11+, Temporal CLI, UV, jq
2. **Validate Conductor JSON**: `jq empty workflow.json`
3. **⚠️ CRITICAL - Before writing code**: Cross-reference your Conductor JSON with [Primitives Reference](./conductor-primitives-reference.md). If HUMAN_TASK/WAIT/approvals exist, read [Human Interaction Patterns](./conductor-human-interaction.md)
4. **Follow migration phases**: Analyze → Generate → Validate → Test
5. **Key mappings**: SIMPLE→Activity, FORK_JOIN→asyncio.gather, SWITCH→if/elif, DO_WHILE→while, HUMAN_TASK→Update/Signal
6. **Run end-to-end**: Start dev server → Start worker → Execute workflow → Validate
7. **Success criteria**: All tests pass, mypy strict passes, workflow executes successfully

## ⚠️ Critical Migration Requirements

**BEFORE writing any Temporal workflow code, you MUST:**

### 1. Examine Your Conductor JSON Against the Primitives Reference

**Every Conductor task type has specific Temporal mappings.** You must cross-reference your Conductor JSON workflow definition with the [Primitives Reference](./conductor-primitives-reference.md) to ensure correct translation.

**Required actions:**
- Identify each task type in your Conductor JSON (`SIMPLE`, `FORK_JOIN`, `SWITCH`, `DO_WHILE`, `HTTP`, `WAIT`, `HUMAN_TASK`, etc.)
- Look up each task type in [conductor-primitives-reference.md](./conductor-primitives-reference.md)
- Follow the documented Temporal pattern for each primitive
- Pay special attention to configuration details (retry policies, timeouts, loop conditions, etc.)

**Example:** If your Conductor JSON has a `DO_WHILE` task, you MUST read the "While Loops" section in the primitives reference to understand:
- How `loopCondition` translates to Python while logic
- When to use `continue-as-new` for long-running loops
- How iteration counters map from `${taskRef.output.iteration}` to Python variables

### 2. Identify and Implement Human-in-the-Loop Patterns

**If your workflow has human interaction, you MUST read the Human Interaction guide.**

**Check your Conductor JSON for these patterns:**
- `HUMAN_TASK` task types
- `WAIT` tasks waiting for external events
- DO_WHILE loops checking for approval status
- References like `${user_action.output.approved}` or `${reviewer.output.decision}`

**If ANY of these exist, you MUST:**
1. Read [conductor-human-interaction.md](./conductor-human-interaction.md) completely
2. Determine whether to use Signals (fire-and-forget) or Updates (request-response)
3. Implement proper timeout handling for human responses
4. Follow the documented patterns for approval workflows, multiple reviewers, or approval loops
5. Write comprehensive tests for human interaction scenarios

**Why this matters:**
- Human interaction patterns are NOT straightforward task-to-activity mappings
- Signals and Updates have different semantics and use cases
- Incorrect implementation can lead to workflows that hang indefinitely or fail validation
- Proper testing of human interaction requires specific testing patterns

## Key Migration Concepts

### Architectural Shift
**Conductor**: Declarative JSON DSL with external state management
**Temporal**: Imperative Python code with automatic event sourcing

### Control Flow Translation
- **SIMPLE** → Activity function with `@activity.defn`
- **FORK_JOIN** → `asyncio.gather()` for parallel execution
- **SWITCH** → Python `if/elif/else` statements
- **DO_WHILE** → Python `while` loop
- **HTTP** → Activity with httpx client

### Data Passing
- `${workflow.input.field}` → `input.field`
- `${task_ref.output}` → `result_variable`
- JSONPath expressions → Python object access

### Key Differences at a Glance

| Aspect | Conductor | Temporal Python |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Definition Style** | JSON DSL | Native Python code |
| **Type Safety** | None (runtime JSON) | Full (MyPy, type hints) |
| **Control Flow** | Operators (SWITCH, FORK, DO_WHILE) | Python constructs (if, for, async) |
| **Data Passing** | JSONPath templates `${task.output.field}` | Direct Python objects |
| **Durability** | Server-managed state | Transparent workflow history |
| **Error Handling** | Task definition config | Python try/except + retry policies |
| **Testing** | Requires server instance | Pure Python unit tests |
| **IDE Support** | JSON schema validation | Full Python IDE features |
| **Debugging** | UI-based workflow visualization | Python debugger + UI |
| **Scheduling** | External tools/plugins | First-class Schedules primitive |
| **Worker Model** | Polling via HTTP/gRPC | Polling with SDK abstractions |
